    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Gordon's spicy sausage rice casserole is a real crowd-pleaser and a delicious, quick and easy-to-make dinner.</p>
    <p>This dish is ready in under 40 minutes and is so easy to make, even I can make it!</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tbsp Olive Oil</li>
        <li>1 Red Onion</li>
        <li>1 Red Bell Pepper</li>
        <li>2 Garlic Cloves</li>
        <li>500g Spiced Sausage</li>
        <li>1 tsp Paprika</li>
        <li>1 cup Long Grain Rice</li>
        <li>1/2 cup Dry White Wine</li>
        <li>2 cups Chicken Stock</li>
        <li>4 Green Onions</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add just 1 tbsp of Olive oil to a heavy-based casserole dish and fry the onion for 5 minutes until soft but not coloured.</li>
        <li>Add the pepper and garlic and cook for 2 minutes while moving it about so the garlic doesn't burn.</li>
        <li>Slit the sausage skins and crumble the sausage meat so it looks like small meatballs.</li>
        <li>Turn the heat to high (otherwise, the sausage will steam rather than brown). Cook while moving it about a bit in the pan for about 4-5 minutes until coloured.</li>
        <li>Add the smoked paprika and mix and season to taste.</li>
        <li>Add the rice and stir well to mix thoroughly and absorb the flavour.</li>
        <li>Now deglaze the pan by pouring in the white wine and scraping any bits stuck to the bottom.</li>
        <li>Add the stock and bring to a boil and then turn to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Cook gently for 15 to 20 minutes until the rice is tender and the liquid almost entirely absorbed. Keep an eye on it and stir from time to time.</li>
        <li>Remove from the heat, gently fold in the spring onions and serve.</li>
    </ol>
